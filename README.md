This is a simple example of a blinky program using the [RTIC](https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic) framework on the STM32F103C8T6 microprocessor.

Keep in mind that I use the [v1.0.x](https://rtic.rs/1/book/en/) version, since in the newest version [v2.0.1](https://rtic.rs/2/book/en/) I encountered an error ( `#![feature]` may not be used on the stable release channel 5:1:1 rustcE0554) which I could not solve.
